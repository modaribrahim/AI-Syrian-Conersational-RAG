        2/ A FACT provided by the student
        
        You are grading RELEVANCE RECALL:
        A score of 1 means that ANY of the statements in the FACT are relevant to the QUESTION. 
        A score of 0 means that NONE of the statements in the FACT are relevant to the QUESTION. 
        1 is the highest (best) score. 0 is the lowest score you can give. 
        
        Explain your reasoning in a step-by-step manner. Ensure your reasoning and conclusion are correct. 
        
        Avoid simply stating the correct answer at the outset.

        Fact: \n\n {documents} \n\n

            - Answer in the language of the question.

            I am building a dataset for an intent classifier with two classes:  
            1Ô∏è‚É£ **"need rag"** (questions that require retrieving information from documents)  
            2Ô∏è‚É£ **"no need rag"** (questions that can be answered directly by a general chatbot).  

            Your task is to generate **"no need rag"** questions, specifically about **Syrian culture, history, and general knowledge**.  
'
            ### **Instructions:**  
            You must generate **diverse** sets of **simple** questions and **casual conversational phrases** related to Syrian culture, history, and general interactions, that can be answered **without retrieval**. Avoid queries that require document or fact-based retrieval.

            #### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Question Types**  
            - **General Knowledge Questions** (short and simple, focused on common knowledge)  
            - Example: "Who was the first ruler of Aleppo?"  
            - Example: "When was the Umayyad Mosque built?"  
            - **Conversational & Interactive Queries**  
            - Example: "Tell me something interesting about Syria."  
            - Example: "What do you think about ancient Syrian architecture?"  
            - **Casual Phrases in Chat Flow**  
            - Example: "Hello!"  
            - Example: "Good morning, how are you?"  
            - Example: "Wow, that‚Äôs interesting!"  
            - Example: "Thank you!"  
            - Example: "What‚Äôs your favorite Syrian food?"  

            #### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Guidelines for Questions:**  
            ‚úÖ Keep them **simple**, **conversational**, and **easy to answer** without relying on documents or specific references.  
            ‚úÖ **DO NOT** ask questions requiring obscure, highly specific, or book-dependent knowledge.  
            ‚úÖ Avoid using **academic or highly historical questions** that necessitate retrieval.  
            ‚úÖ Ensure **variety** in sentence structure (e.g., What, How, When, Tell me, Describe, Greetings, Expressing interests).  
            ‚úÖ Mix between **long and short** questions.  
            ‚úÖ **DO NOT** ask about the **Syrian Civil War**.  

            #### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Conversational Phrases to Avoid:**  
            To make sure there is no confusion, **avoid** questions or greetings that could be misinterpreted as needing document-based answers:
            - **"Tell me"** and similar constructions should focus on **simple** information, not detailed facts (e.g., "Tell me about Syria" is fine; "Tell me about the collapse of the Aleppo economy in the 15th century" is not).  
            - **Casual greetings** and conversational phrases like **"Good morning"**, **"Hello!"**, **"How are you?"**, **"What‚Äôs up?"**, or **"Tell me a joke"** should be included as **no need rag**.  

            ### **Response Format (Strictly Follow This Format AND ONLY THIS Format, DO NOT REPLY WITH SOMETHING ELSE)**

            - Avoid referencing specific entities, authors, or sections of the text.
            - The questions should be varied in type: some should require short, specific answers, and others should require more detailed responses.
            - Keep the questions concise and focused, ensuring they are suitable for assessing comprehension and critical thinking.
            - The questions should only and only focus on heritage, history and culture.
            - Don't write something like 'according to the text' in any of the questions, there is not text seen by the model we are testing, it only sees your questions separately from each other.
